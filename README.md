# HUD Messages
> Add silly or useful messages to your in-game HUD

## Synopsis
This mod for Titanfall 2 uses the Northstar modloader.
You can use the chat as a console to add or remove messages.
These messages can be static or dynamic.
Dynamic messages can use some preset trackers or custom logic.

## Purpose
To serve as a joke or for utility!
Usages could be:
- A kill/death ratio tracker
- A kill tracker
- A silly random message you can set
- And more!

## Contributing
Please adhere to these style guidelines.
- 4-width soft (space) tabs
- Ensure each logic file has a descriptive banner:
```c
// {description}
// All code is licensed under the BSD 2-clause license -- see `LICENSE`
//
// Section:
//   Lorem ipsum
```
- No space between function identifier and its parentheses
- Code block opening brace stays on the same line as defining keywords (such as `function`), while closing brace gets its own
- Function names are camelCase, while structs/enums/etc. are PascalCase.

## QnA
**Q:** Why was CYNHUD deprecated?  
**A:** It was written horribly ðŸ˜… It was very janky, and was single-file.  
<sub>Though it was somewhat small, so I guess it was fine.<sub>
